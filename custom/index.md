I'm a 21-year-old guy based in Brazil.

My interests range from [music](https://last.fm/user/auugus) to epistemology, [minimalism](https://old.reddit.com/r/zerobags/), and lifestyle.


### Facts

- I can speak Portuguese, English, Spanish, and a funny mixing of German and
English.
- I taught myself English between the ages of 6 and 12 through YouTube commentary
videos.
- I'm a programmer by trade. I usually do Java, JavaScript or any language required by my employer.
- I wrote my first line of code when I was 11.
- Installed Linux for the first time as a kid, using a DVD that I've burned
myself.
